Warning: Provider block in terraform module is expected to have and only have `alias` declared (terraform_module_provider_declaration)

  on main.tf line 1:
   1: provider "azurerm" {

Reference: https:///blob/v0.0.1/docs/rules/terraform_module_provider_declaration.md
```

## Why
The declaration of `provider` block in module is not expected unless it has and only has `alias` field declared to prevent bugs.
See https://www.terraform.io/language/modules/develop/providers

## How To Fix
Consider remove the `provider` block from terraform module or reformat it to have and only have `alias` field declared
